## Introduction
This model is intended to explore the impact of different staff settings on winning percentage in a competitive environment.Suppose there are two teams A and B with equal number of members. Group B is made up of 50% winning rate teamplayers. The other group A consists of people with different winning percentages (to simplify the model, we suppose there are only two types of memebers, stronger one with more than 50% possibility to win and the weaker one with less than 50% winning rate). The two groups of people can only have one-to-one competition once.
More details are in the 'info' of the model.
